### 任务2：论述型作文 - 双边讨论

#### 题目描述

- Some people say that the main environmental problem of our time is the loss of particular species of plants and animals. Others say that there are more important environmental problems. 
  Discuss both these views and give your own opinion. 

#### 答题思路

- 要注意两种观点都要讨论，即两方的观点都要给出相应support的evidence，再去论述己方观点。本文选择把己方观点放在反方观点的后面，在第二个主体段的论述中也融合了climate change is a more important issue这一点，最后再在结尾段重述。 


#### 范文
> Environmental issues have become increasingly diverse and complex in recent times. 
  While some argue that the loss of specific species is the most pressing concern, I firmly believe that climate change presents a far more immediate and life-threatening problem. 
  This essay aims to support this viewpoint by examining the potential consequences of species extinction and highlighting the urgent nature of climate change.

> It is undeniable that the extinction of species can have detrimental effects on ecosystems and biodiversity. 
  When key species vanish, the delicate balance of ecosystems is compromised, leading to a chain reaction of ecological disruptions. 
  This, in turn, can trigger catastrophes such as natural disasters and habitat degradation, further endangering other species that rely on those habitats. 
  The loss of biodiversity is a significant concern, but it may not pose an immediate threat to human survival.

> However, when considering the urgency of environmental issues, climate change emerges as a more critical concern. 
  The adverse impacts of climate change are evident through the ever-increasing occurrence of extreme weather events. 
  These events, such as hurricanes, floods, and droughts, not only cause immense property damage but also result in the loss of human lives. 
  Moreover, rising sea levels due to climate change pose a direct threat to coastal regions and islands, leading to the displacement of communities and the potential loss of entire nations. 
  It is clear that climate change has more direct and immediate consequences for human existence.

> While the loss of specific species is undoubtedly a cause for concern, the urgency of climate change surpasses the immediate threat posed by the decline of biodiversity. 
  The adverse impacts of climate change, including extreme weather events and rising sea levels, directly jeopardize human lives and property. 
  It is crucial that we prioritize efforts to mitigate climate change and take immediate action to address this pressing environmental issue. 
  By doing so, we can safeguard not only the diverse array of species on Earth but also the future of humanity.

近年来，环境问题变得日益多样化和复杂化。尽管有人认为特定物种的丧失是最紧迫的问题，但我坚信气候变化才是更为紧迫且危及生命的问题。本文旨在支持这一观点，通过探讨物种灭绝可能带来的后果，并强调气候变化的紧迫性。

不可否认，物种灭绝对生态系统和生物多样性产生了不利影响。当关键物种消失时，生态系统的微妙平衡受到破坏，引发了一系列生态紊乱的连锁反应。这反过来可能导致自然灾害和栖息地退化等灾难，进一步危及依赖这些栖息地的其他物种。生物多样性的丧失是一个重要问题，但可能不会对人类的生存构成直接威胁。

然而，当考虑环境问题的紧迫性时，气候变化显现出更为重要的关切。气候变化的不利影响通过日益增多的极端天气事件变得明显。这些事件，如飓风、洪水和干旱，不仅造成巨大的财产损失，还导致人员伤亡。此外，气候变化导致海平面上升直接威胁沿海地区和岛屿，引发社区流离失所，可能导致整个国家的损失。显然，气候变化对人类存在具有更为直接和紧迫的影响。

虽然特定物种的丧失无疑令人担忧，但气候变化的紧迫性超过了生物多样性减少带来的直接威胁。气候变化的不利影响，包括极端天气事件和海平面上升，直接危及人类的生命和财产。我们必须优先考虑减轻气候变化的努力，并立即采取行动解决这一紧迫的环境问题。通过这样做，我们不仅可以保护地球上丰富多样的物种，也能确保人类的未来。




#### 写作

> Nowadays, we face a multitude of environmental issues that require our attention and action. 
  While some people focus on the loss of specific species, I believe there are several other crucial environmental problems that should take top priority.

> One pressing concern is the disruption of animal habitats caused by climate change. 
  Rising temperatures, primarily driven by carbon emissions, have altered the living conditions for many species. 
  For instance, polar bears are losing their homes due to the diminishing ice cover, preventing them from hunting and finding sustenance.

> Another significant issue is air pollution, which affects both humans and animals alike. 
  Recent years have witnessed a concerning rise in cancer cases attributed to air pollution. 
  Additionally, marine life suffers greatly from water pollution, leading to the decline of several species. 
  Tackling pollution is paramount to preserving our ecosystem.

> Furthermore, deforestation, driven by the need for housing expansion, poses a severe threat to the environment. 
  Trees play a vital role in preventing natural disasters and maintaining the balance of ecosystems. 
  Therefore, efforts to preserve forests and increase tree coverage are essential to prevent further damage.

> While the extinction of specific plant and animal species is undoubtedly heart-wrenching, it is crucial to address the broader range of environmental issues. 
  Governments should raise public awareness and encourage collective responsibility to protect our planet. 
  We must all take action to mitigate the impact of human activities and safeguard the diversity of life on Earth.

> In conclusion, while the loss of particular species is devastating, there are several other pressing environmental issues that demand our immediate attention. 
  Governments, as well as individuals, have an obligation to protect our planet and its creatures. 
  By addressing climate change, pollution, and deforestation, we can work towards a more sustainable future for all. 

如今，我们面临着众多需要我们关注和行动的环境问题。虽然一些人关注特定物种的丧失，但我认为还有其他几个至关重要的环境问题应该优先考虑。

一个紧迫的问题是气候变化导致的动物栖息地破坏。由碳排放主导的不断上升的温度改变了许多物种的生存条件。例如，由于冰层减少，北极熊失去了栖息地，无法捕猎和寻找食物。

另一个重要问题是空气污染，这影响人类和动物。近年来，由空气污染引起的癌症病例数量令人担忧。此外，水污染极大地影响海洋生物，导致多个物种数量减少。解决污染问题对于保护生态系统至关重要。

此外，由于住房扩张的需要，森林砍伐对环境构成了严重威胁。树木在预防自然灾害和维持生态系统平衡方面发挥着重要作用。因此，保护森林和增加树木覆盖率的努力对于防止进一步的破坏至关重要。

尽管特定植物和动物物种的灭绝无疑令人痛心，但解决更广泛的环境问题至关重要。政府应提高公众意识，鼓励集体责任保护我们的星球。我们所有人都必须采取行动来减轻人类活动的影响，保护地球上的生物多样性。

总之，虽然特定物种的丧失是令人痛心的，但还有其他几个迫切的环境问题需要我们立即关注。政府和个人都有责任保护我们的星球和其生物。通过解决气候变化、污染和森林砍伐问题，我们可以为所有人实现更可持续的未来。
